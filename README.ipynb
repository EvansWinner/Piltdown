    "\n",
    "I mean, they're pretty obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is only so much you can do with nothing but text that is always left-justified, displayed in a very narrow column, and in a variable-width font--even with Unicode. If you think you can pull off a scatter plot with variable width Unicode in the space of a tweet, by all means, send me a PR.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Screen readers. I don't know how many times I mention it below, but Unicode hacks are inherently unfriendly to the blind. Beware.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You will see weird font compatibility issues. Github won't even render everything right every time in this README on Qutebrowser under Linux for me. Sometimes the column sparkline glyphs are weirdly off-center, sometimes the tally marks are missing.... Who knows? Some platform/font combinations render this stuff correctly, some don't. That's just all there is to it.\n",

    "### The Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the types of plot, you will specify your data set,\n",
    "(typically a list, list of tuples, dict, etc.).\n",
    "Generating this from a dataframe or other form is your problem--Piltdown just generates strings. That's all.\n",
    "There are a million utilities that could be included\n",
    "to post your string to Twitter for you,\n",
    "or to do other Unicode tricks,\n",
    "like bold or italics,\n",
    "but at least for the moment\n",
    "Piltdown wants to do one thing and do it (tollerably) well:\n",
    "generate strings that work as data viz in the space of a tweet.\n",
    "That means generally just the graphic elements and sometimes axis labels.\n",
    "Titles and keys are mostly your problem.\n",
    "But the idea is that all you have to do is concatenate any string you want\n",
    "with the output of your Piltdown graph,\n",
    "and thus becometh Robert your parent's brother.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Clone the repository, `cd` to your new `piltdown` directory, and then do --\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install .\n",
    "    \n",
    "or the local equivalent (eg. `pip3 install .` )\n",
    "\n",
    "Or at some point maybe I will make it installable from PyPi or whatever it's called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can just, like, load up the files any old way you want. It's pretty simple.\n",
    "\n",
