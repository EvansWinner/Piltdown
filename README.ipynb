    "*or, What is it? and what's it for?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Piltdown is a tiny, nay, even trivial Python library\n",
    "that generates Unicode strings of bar charts\n",
    "and some other data visualization thingies\n",
    "which are meant to be included in your Twitter posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the Documentation section below for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of charts, you ask? Also see the Documentation section for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "But see all the caveats.\n",
    "I mean, they're pretty obvious.\n",
    "There is only so much you can do with nothing but text\n",
    "that is always left-justified,\n",
    "displayed in a very narrow column,\n",
    "and in a variable-width font--\n",
    "even with Unicode.\n",
    "If you think you can pull off a scatter plot with variable width Unicode in the space of a tweet, by all means, send me a PR.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this for the fun of it,\n",
    "on a lark. Don't get all testy with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the types of plot, you will specify your data set,\n",
    "(typically a list, list of tuples, dict, etc.).\n",
    "Generating this from a datafrane or other form is your problem--Piltdown just generates strings. That's all.\n",
    "There are a million utilities that could be included\n",
    "to post your string to Twitter for you,\n",
    "or to do other Unicode tricks,\n",
    "like bold or italics,\n",
    "but at least for the moment\n",
    "Piltdown wants to do one thing and do it (tollerably) well:\n",
    "generate strings that work as data viz in the space of a tweet.\n",
    "That means generally just the graphic elements and sometimes axis labels.\n",
    "Titles and keys are mostly your problem.\n",
    "But the idea is that all you have to do is concatenate any string you want\n",
    "with the output of your Piltdown graph,\n",
    "and thus becometh Robert your parent's brother.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Clone the repository and do \n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install .\n",
    "    \n",
    "or the local equivalent (eg. pip3 install . )\n",
    "\n",
    "Or at some point maybe I will make it installable from PyPi or whatever it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can just, like, load up the files any old way you want. It's pretty simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, if you do the pip thing, then import things as you need them as per the examples in, you guessed it, the Documentation section below.\n"
